## Interfaces

This is a list of interfaces found on the compromised machine. It could be useful for easier navigation of internal networks: which interface to run a redirector on, which networks are potentially accessible via this particular session and so on.

## Routes

A list of routes is here mainly for visibility purposes: as already mentioned, the selection highlight is synchronized with sessions and redirectors, also the visual markers (those colored flags) provide a good visual representation of the current state.

Its context menu allows for deletion of selected route.

## Redirectors

This is functionally the same as routes, but represents redirectors.

Its context menu allows for deletion of selected route.
